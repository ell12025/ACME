# Content Management System

This program was from some of my coding course work. The challenge was to create a CMS type program that would be able to upload, modify and delete documents, professor profiles and the ability to participate in a message board. The application pulls in data from Googles Firebase. From there a user can delete, modify or create a new document or user profile which then gets pushed back to the database for storage after the item was saved.
